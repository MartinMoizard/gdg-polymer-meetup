gdg-polymer-meetup
==================

Sample project to show how easily Polymer can be integrated in an Angular2 project

Why this repo?
--------------

I gave a talk at the Paris GDG meetup to show how cool Polymer is, and that you can still use it even though your project has nothing to do with it (like an Angular project).
